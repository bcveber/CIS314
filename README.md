# CIS314
Coding work done in CIS 314 (Computer Organization) at University of Oregon

## Projects:
* cachesimulation - Simulates a simple 64B direct-mapped cache with 4B blocks (16 cache sets) in C. Caching theory.
* intarray - Allocates, initalizes, and sorts (as necessary) an array in C. Functions include free, read, swap, sort, and print.
* integersort - Sorts an array of integers in Y86. *Sort* accomplished via bubble sort, *swap* performs actual swaps in memory. 
* swap - Implements a swap procedure in Y86.
* allAssignments - contains all weekly assignments. However, I tried to pull some of the bigger ones and add them above.
